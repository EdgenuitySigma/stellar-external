# Selfleak Roblox External

# READ ME FIRST
- As stated before, I will not be helping with any sort of support for this project. If your delving into externals this far, dont be a skid and learn how to read this and grasp a concent of the code!
# Changelogs
- Fixed some independacies being missing or not being able to open upon building. Attempted to fix the ESP rendering but it was written kinda weird so I wont be messing around with that.
- Fixed the main-Loader function where the protection where in place originally. Such changes can be found when you read the code for yourself!
- Offsets working as of: Roblox version - version-6fdcfe060c6440cd
